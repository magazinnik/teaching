# Teaching

A collection of tutorials and code snippets my students have found useful. 

## maps

1. **election 2016**: Originally given as my R Camp final, a tutorial on creating maps from electoral returns. 

2. **`maps` quirk and `tmaps` fix**: Documenting some buggy behavior of the `maps` package, and a brief tutorial on
`tmaps`, which offers greater flexibility (with help from Will Lowe). 

## plots

1. **predprobs**: Making predicted probability plots (with confidence intervals computed by quasi-Bayesian
simulation) from regression output. I will turn this into a proper tutorial soon, but posting some 
(hopefully) adaptable code for now since it's the thing people most often want from me. 

## etc

1. **birthday_plot**: Brighten someone's day. Make them a birthday plot.
